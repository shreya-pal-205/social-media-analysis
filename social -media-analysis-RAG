#Social Media Performance Analysis - Pre-Hackathon Assignment Overview

The Social Media Performance Analysis project is a basic analytics tool developed for the Level Supermind Hackathon Pre-Hackathon Assignment. The tool uses Langflow, DataStax Astra DB, and Gemini to analyze engagement data from mock social media accounts and provide insights into how different post types (carousel, reels, static images) perform in terms of likes, shares, and comments. The project aims to help users understand how various social media formats impact engagement metrics. Hackathon Details
"""Assignment: Pre-Hackathon Social Media Performance Analysis
"""Deadline: January 10th, 2025
"""Hackathon Link: Level Supermind Hackathon - Social Media Analysis

#Objective

The main objective of this project was to develop an analytics module that:

"""Simulates engagement data for social media posts (likes, shares, comments).
"""Stores this data in DataStax Astra DB.
"""Analyzes post performance based on these metrics.
"""Provides insights using Gemini based on the analyzed data.
#Tools & Technologies Used
"""DataStax Astra DB: Cloud-based database used to store and query social media engagement data.
"""Langflow: A workflow creation tool that integrates with Gemini to generate insights from the data.
"""Gemini: An AI-powered language model integrated into Langflow to generate insights from engagement data.

"""HTML/CSS/JavaScript/React: Front-end technologies used to build the user interface of the web application.
#Features

1. Data Generation & Storage
A small mock dataset was generated representing social media engagement data for different post types (carousel, reels, static images). This dataset includes the following metrics:

"""Likes
"""Shares
"""Comments
"""Post Types
The data was then stored in DataStax Astra DB for further analysis. 
2. Post Performance Analysis

Using Langflow, a simple workflow was created to:

"""Accept different post types as input (carousel, reels, static images).
"""Query the dataset in Astra DB to calculate the average engagement metrics (likes, shares, comments) for each post type.
This allows users to analyze and compare how different post types perform in terms of engagement. 3. Insights Generation

With Gemini integration via Langflow, insights were generated based on the engagement data. Example insights include:

"Carousel posts have 20% higher engagement than static posts."
"Reels drive 2x more comments than static images or carousels."
These insights help users understand the impact of different content types on social media engagement and assist in making data-driven decisions.
